Log Files and Regular Expressions

A log file is used to store the happenings on any given website. I've aquired just such a log file, and I would like some help analyzing it (Credit for this file goes to Merve Baş Seyyar, Ferhat Özgür Çatak, and Ensar Gül (https://github.com/ocatak/apache-http-logs/). The apache log file can be found in the data file on canvas.

Use regular expressions to extract data from the log file and answer the following questions using plots in jupyter notebook. The format of the apache log file is combined log format"

1. What browsers are used to access this website? Are there some that are more common than others?
2. What websites/IP addresses bring this website the most traffic?
3. Are there specific times of the year that the website recieves more traffic than other times?
4. This logfile is suppose to contain some malicious attempts to alter the site. Do you see any evidence of this? 

Write up an email you would send to your boss who has asked you to research these questions (as a text, word, etc. document) and upload it along with your code to your git repository.
